Did you ever think that Raw Cheese is NOT just a pizza ingredient or a wine appetizer?


## Description 

A properly prepared cheese made from elite milk strengthens teeth. Hair. Gives vitality and energy.


### What is elite milk?

 This is milk, which was milked from an animal that was pasture-raised, ate only fresh grass and plants that were not poisoned by chemicals. They also did not take antibiotics. The milk was not heated, not pasteurized. It is fresh and warm. This milk is really elite.

## Cheese options

I make 2 types of cheese - **Cow cheese and Goat cheese**.
