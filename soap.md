## Melting Butter
I make soap using a cold process. This process allows me to preserve the **beneficial qualities** of the oils. I only order butter&oil that can be used for food.

## Cocoa Butter

The first main ingredient. Nourishes the skin and leaves no residue. Ordinary soap contains very low quality butters. To remove their side effects, manufacturers add paraffin and fragrances. Therefore they leave odors.
## Shea Butter

Shea butter is the second main ingredient. it makes the soap light and creamy. Due to the structure of shea butter, the soap gives a velvety effect.

## Olive Oil

Olive oil is needed to provide a moisturizing effect. Extra virgin from Spain, creates the effect of lightness and freshness.

## Coconut Oil

Thai extra virgin coconut oil is my favorite. I add the same that I buy for food. It is also needed to moisturize and nourish the skin. Its texture lends lightness.
