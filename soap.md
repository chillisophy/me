{%- if site.soap contains "://" -%}
{%- assign soap = site.soap -%}
{%- else -%}
{%- assign soap = site.soap | relative_url -%}

## Melting Butter
I make soap using a cold process. This process allows me to preserve the **beneficial qualities** of the oils. I only order butter&oil that can be used for food.

<br />
{%- if site.melting contains "://" -%}
{%- assign melting = site.melting -%}
{%- else -%}
{%- assign melting = site.melting | relative_url -%}
{%- endif -%}
<img src="{{ melting }}" class="cheese-image" alt="">

## Cocoa Butter 
<br />
{%- if site.cocoa contains "://" -%}
{%- assign cocoa = site.cocoa -%}
{%- else -%}
{%- assign cocoa = site.cocoa | relative_url -%}
{%- endif -%}
<img src="{{ cocoa }}" class="cheese-image" alt="">

**The first main ingredient.** <br /> Nourishes the skin and leaves no residue. Ordinary soap contains very low quality butters. To remove their side effects, manufacturers add paraffin and fragrances. Therefore they leave odors.
## Shea Butter
<br />
{%- if site.sheabutter contains "://" -%}
{%- assign sheabutter = site.sheabutter -%}
{%- else -%}
{%- assign sheabutter = site.sheabutter | relative_url -%}
{%- endif -%}
<img src="{{ sheabutter }}" class="cheese-image" alt="">

**Shea butter is the second main ingredient.** <br />  it makes the soap light and creamy. Due to the structure of shea butter, the soap gives a velvety effect.

## Olive Oil
<br />
{%- if site.olive contains "://" -%}
{%- assign olive = site.olive -%}
{%- else -%}
{%- assign olive = site.olive | relative_url -%}
{%- endif -%}
<img src="{{ olive }}" class="cheese-image" alt="">

**Olive oil is needed to provide a moisturizing effect.**<br />  Extra virgin from Spain, creates the effect of lightness and freshness.

## Coconut Oil
<br />
{%- if site.coco contains "://" -%}
{%- assign coco = site.coco -%}
{%- else -%}
{%- assign coco = site.coco | relative_url -%}
{%- endif -%}
<img src="{{ coco }}" class="cheese-image" alt="">

**Thai extra virgin coconut oil is my favorite.**<br /> I add the same that I buy for food. It is also needed to moisturize and nourish the skin. Its texture lends lightness.
