From Healing Herbs to
Deadly Drugs:
Western Medicine's War
Against the Natural World
### Marti Kheel




Most people in the western world conceive of "alternative healing" as a
deviation from the norm. Modern western medicine, by contrast, is typically
viewed as the culmination of a long, steady march toward progress and
truth. Through a collective lapse of memory, our culture seems to have
forgotten that modern western medicine is a relatively recent phenomenon
and that most of what is now called "alternative healing" has been practiced
for thousands of years throughout the world. Ironically, the true "alternative"
is modern western medicine which represents the greatest deviation in
healing the world has ever known.1
At the heart of this deviation lies a dramatic transformation in our
society's attitude toward the natural world. Along with this change there has
been a drastic alteration in our conception of animals and of their role in
helping humans to attain health. Perhaps, nowhere can this change be more
clearly illustrated than in the changeover from one of the most ancient forms
of healing to one of the most common forms of medicine today-namely, the
shift from the use of healing herbs to the use of deadly drugs.
Herbal healing is considered by many to be the earliest form of healing.2
It has been practiced by lay women healers for thousands of years and still
remains the chief form of healing in most parts of the world. Women, in
fact, have been the primary healers throughout history. According to World
Health Organization figures, they still provide 95 percent of the world's
health care needs.3 Their practices have grown out of a rich tradition of
holistic healing. Sadly, this tradition has been destroyed throughout much of
the western world. Women "healers" now typically fill the ranks of the
nursing profession where they play a role subordinate to the (male-
dominated) "scientifically" trained medical elite. One of their chief functions
is the dispensing of chemicals and drugs that only doctors are permitted to
prescribe. Drugs-not herbs-have become the major treatment for the sick.
And women have become the major consumers (and victims) of such drugs.4
In order to comprehend the transition from herbs to drugs and the transfer
of power from women to men that accompanied it, we must understand the
worldviews out of which both forms of healing evolved.5 Herbal healing
derives from a holistic worldview most fully expressed in matriarchal
societies of the prehistoric world. These cultures regarded all parts of nature
as interconnected aspects of a nurturing whole-the sacred Mother Earth.
"Matter" (which derives from the same root word as "mother") was seen as
a living being with a life force of her own. To use poultices, roots, and herbs
was to trust in her healing energy and her vital force.
1From Healing Herbs to Deadly Drugs 2
Women and nature were revered in these cultures and were seen as
closely allied. Plants and animals were often depicted in close association
with goddesses or seen as goddesses themselves. In every part of the world,
a goddess was, at one time, invoked in time of sickness.6 Alternately, she
has taken the form of a plant, a snake, a cow, a lion, a female guardian
spirit, and later on, the Virgin Mary. In numerous cultures, from the
American Indians to the ancient Hebrews and the Greeks, the snake has
been associated with deities of healing.7 In the Judeo-Christian tradition,
we see how far we have come from this earlier conception. Both a woman
and an animal- Eve and the snake- are viewed as the source of all evil in the
world.
The holistic philosophy of the early matriarchal cultures was reflected in
a holistic attitude toward illness and health. The common premise of all
holistic healing is the notion that the whole person, not simply their
symptoms or their "disease," must be treated. Illness is not conceived as a
single disease with a specific "cure" but, rather, as an expression of
disharmony with the natural world. Both the inner "environment" of the
body and the outer environment of the surrounding world are seen as an
integrated whole.
The holistic tradition out of which herbal healing evolved honored not
only the power of the body to heal, but that of the mind (or spirit) as well.
Prayer, chants, incantations and other forms of ritual frequently
accompanied both the preparation and the ingestion of herbs. Often, such
ceremonies were seen as essential components of an herb's divine power,
without which the healing process could not occur.
Healing was associated, in the early matriarchal cultures, with the life-
giving capacities of women. The two main goddesses of healing, Hygea
and Panacea, were also the names of the Great Goddess's milk-giving
breasts.8 Our own word "nurse" carries this age-old association with
women's life-giving, nurturing powers.
For most of human history, lay women healers have seen nature as their
ally. Working with the substances of the earth and the body's own healing
energy, they have sought to fortify health, not attack disease. Lay women
healers have prepared ointments, poultices, herbal teas and baths to relieve
pain and to help restore the body to health. They have provided
contraceptive measures, performed abortions, and eased the pain of labor.
They have washed sores, set bones, massaged painful joints, and performed
rituals and prayers. For many women, knowledge of herbal preparations has
been as common as is the knowledge of cooking today.9
Just as herbal healing rests upon a holistic world view, modern drug-
oriented medicine derives from dualistic ideas. Whereas the holistic
perspective honors the healing energy of the body and of the earth, modern
western medicine is founded upon a distrust of nature and nature's power to
heal. The history of western medicine is that of a long protracted struggle to
conquer and subdue the vital force of nature; it is the attempt to render her
inert. Significantly, in patriarchal cosmologies, it is the logos or the nous (the
"word" or the "mind") which gives birth to the world, not nature or the
Goddess herself, as was formerly believed. Increasingly, the vital force of
life, including the power to heal, is no longer seen to rest in "mere matter,"
(the body or the Earth), but rather in the "rational," "scientific" (male) mind.
Two of the most important notions that contributed to the demise of the
former worldview can be found in the philosophy of Francis Bacon and that
of Rene Descartes. According to Bacon, nature could be viewed as a
mysterious virgin whose secrets needed to be penetrated by the tools of
science. Baconian science sought to discover "still laid up in the womb of
nature many secrets of excellent use" that no man had reached before. The
point was no longer just to know nature but to conquer and subdue her with
the power of the "rational" (masculine) mind.3 HEALING THE WOUNDS
The Cartesian world view carried the conquest of nature to its logical
extreme-i.e., to the point of death. Nature, which was viewed as female,
was relegated to an inferior and inactive realm, apart from "rational man."
In contrast to the "vitalists," who believed there was an irreducible, vital
aspect to all life, Descartes maintained that nature conformed to mechanical
(chemical) laws. According to this view, nature was a machine, devoid of
both rationality and soul. Animals, who were also machines, could
experience no pain. Their cries of anguish upon being dissected were mere
mechanical response.
The twin notions of conquering nature and of viewing nature as a
machine have become the life-blood of modern western medicine.
According to the modern, scientific viewpoint, disease reflects a failure in
the body machinery. When disease strikes, it is the body's machinery that
must be repaired. Whether the repair takes the form of surgery, a drug, or
the replacement of "defective" body parts, such adjustments must be
performed by those thought to have the necessary technology, expertise,
and skill. The doctor and the doctor's tools alone can mend the failed
machine.
Since the modern medical body is conceived as a machine, it is also
thought to conform to Newtonian laws of cause and effect. Disease and ill
health are thus seen to have a single, external "cause"- usually viruses,
bacteria and other microorganisms. In order to restore health to the body,
the offending agent need only be identified and rooted out. Typically, these
enemy organisms are fought with chemical weapons forced from nature on
another battlefront- the modern research laboratory.
This reductionistic view of the healing process has become so entrenched
that it is difficult for many people to conceive of healing in any other way.
And, yet, the concept of "one disease-one cure" (and one drug) is equally
alien to the holistic view.10 In the holistic tradition, only a single disease
exists- namely, an imbalance or a lack of harmony with nature, whether
within oneself or with the rest of the natural world.
Today, drugs have become the primary weapon employed by western
medicine in its war against disease. Rather than trust in the healing power
of nature- i.e., poultices, plants, and the body's own healing energy- western
medicine prefers to respond to the "affront" of disease with an assault of its
own. Just as Bacon sought to "storm the bastions" of nature with the tools
of science, modern western medicine has declared a war of its own. It is a
war waged against the body and all of the natural world. Unable to trust in
the healing power of nature, western medicine prefers to "penetrate nature"
in order to produce "cures" of its own. Plants are no longer valued in and of
themselves. Rather, the most powerful properties of plants must be isolated,
extracted and then synthesized into chemicals and drugs. Nature is seen as a
resource which is useful only when transformed by men's rational mind.
The human body has become the central battlefield in western medicine's
war against disease. Thus, two of the weapons used in the "war" against
cancer are nitrogen mustard and radiation, both weapons used during the
last world wars. The terminology of warfare permeates the modern, medical
world. Thus, we hear of the "war on cancer" declared by presidential decree
in 1971. We hear, too, of "bombarding" cells with an arsenal of drugs and of
"magic bullets" that "target" cancerous sites. Conversely, we often hear of
our alleged enemies described as cancerous growths or other forms of
disease. Most of all, we hear that the war will be won, provided, of course,
that biomedical research scientists are given sufficient funds.
It should come as no surprise, however, that the "war on cancer" (and
other diseases) has produced more victims than cures.11 Indeed, the warfare
mentality of western medicine has made medical casualties a routine part of
our world. In the United States, prescription drugs have become a major
cause of iatrogenic (doctor-induced) disease, causing more deaths each yearFrom Healing Herbs to Deadly Drugs 4
than accidents on the road.12 "According to the FDA, 1. 5 million
Americans had to be hospitalized in 1978 as a consequence of taking drugs
(which were supposed to 'cure' them of something or other). And some
thirty percent of all hospitalized people get further damaged by the therapy
that is imposed on them. The number of people killed in the U.S. by the
intake of drugs has been estimated at some 140,000 each year."13 Drug
therapy has become so routine that 60 percent of American doctors
prescribe antibiotics for the common cold.14 Unfortunately, many drug
"side effects" only appear after years of use, making it impossible to
anticipate what such effects will be.
Meanwhile, the medical assault on our bodies is compounded by a
chemical attack on another front- i.e., by the pesticides, additives and other
chemicals and drugs that routinely pollute our water, food, and air. This
massive chemical attack is wreaking untold damage on the "ecology" of
our bodies and thus on our only genuine "defense" against disease- our
body's natural immunological response.15
Faith in the medical profession has emerged largely unharmed by the
prevalence of drug toxicity and drug abuse. On the contrary, most people
now accord doctors the same reverence once reserved for priests delivering
their sacraments to those who would be saved. And, yet, the veneration that
today's doctors have come to expect as their due was only won through a
long protracted struggle against all forms of healing that have not
conformed to their own. The history of this battle takes us back many
years.
Western medicine traces its scientific origins to the Hippocratic
medicine of ancient Greece. Although this body of writing largely
embraced sound holistic principles, it also contained the seeds of the
dualistic mentality that later came to prevail. The theoretical conception of
illness found in the notion of the four humors eventually led to the
mechanistic notion of regulating disease and to the idea of forcibly driving
(or draining) illness out. In Hippocratic medicine, the patient's symptoms
were aggravated to the point of a healing crisis. Purgings, bleedings,
induced vomitings and other "heroic" feats were some of the methods
employed in this task. The notion of "aiding" nature had already led to the
practice (by male physicians) of giving her a "helpful" shove. Meanwhile,
witches and faith healers were branded by Hippocrates as charlatans and
quacks.
It was not until the thirteenth century, however, that the attack on lay
women healers became institutionalized. It was at this time that laws were
passed requiring physicians to obtain licenses and medical training. Since
universities were almost universally closed to women, lay women healers
were, in effect, barred from the legal practice of medicine. There was,
however, little in medical training or practice that we would recognize as
"science." Medical students confined most of their studies to astrology,
religion, and philosophy and read more of Plato, Aristotle, and Christian
theology than medical theory. The heroic medicine espoused by the
Hippocratic tradition had become the favored form of treatment for the
sick. However, the purgatives used were no longer derived from plants
alone but were also extracted from the far more toxic mineral world. The
administration of mercury, lead and arsenic (along with blood-letting) had
become routine practices. For centuries, physicians were too preoccupied
with the correctness of their medical theories to notice that their treatments
often caused more harm than good.16
Although it was the white, upper-class, male medical profession that,
under the guise of science, ultimately wrested control from lay women
healers, it was the church that initiated the first major blow. An estimated
nine million people (mostly women) were executed or burned as witches
between 1479 and 1735.17 Interestingly, one of the titles for witches was
"herberia," meaning "one who gathers herbs."18 Often, the crime such5 HEALING THE WOUNDS
women were accused of was literally their ability to heal. This attack by
the church was, at once, directed against the Goddess-worshipping religion
which embodied a reverence for all of the natural world and against the
peasantry which lived by this tradition and passed its knowledge on.
In order to comprehend why healing should be considered a crime, it is
necessary to understand the church's attitude toward women and all of the
natural world. According to the church, the vital, healing force of nature
resided not within the earth, but rather, within a male, sky God. Disease,
illness, and even labor pains, were all expressions of God's will. Only
church-approved individuals (mostly men with university training and the
priests with whom they were obliged to consult) could work within "God's
plan."
While the church was wielding its attack against lay women, the field of
science was slowly developing ideas that would ultimately pose a far more
serious challenge. The fields of physiology and chemistry, which evolved
in part out of the herbal tradition, were subtly supplanting this tradition by
subsuming it into a "science." The herbal tradition was not, however, fully
usurped by science until many years later. Herbalism continued to be
practiced throughout the countryside by lay women healers. Even up until
the 1800s, most people consulted herbalists when sick. Drug preparations
consisted primarily of "crude plants- i.e., ground up leaves, flowers and
roots, or teas, extracts and tinctures of them. Medicine and botany were
still intimately allied."19 By the middle of the nineteenth century, at least in
the United States and Europe, 80 percent of medicines used were still
derived from plants. Today, less than 30 percent of the drugs used are
plant-based.20
Only with the rise of the large pharmaceutical industries in the late
nineteenth century and with the increased faith in science did the "regular"
physicians successfully defeat the herbal, homeopathic, and other holistic
traditions. The would-be medical profession saw in the rising
pharmaceutical industry an opportunity to bolster its flagging reputation
through an increased association with technology and science. To their
good fortune, the pharmaceutical industry saw in the "regular" physicians
an ideal vehicle for marketing their new drugs. The pharmaceutical
industries, thus, began an all-out campaign (which has been continued to
this day) to convince the "regulars" to prescribe their drugs. At the same
time, the medical profession began an equally virulent drive to discredit the
holistic practitioners (i.e., the "irregulars") for failing to fulfill the
requirements of a "science." Thus, the fateful marriage between western
medicine and science was sealed and the future course of western medicine
was set.
The rise to prominence of the "regular" physicians went hand in hand
with the rise of an elite, white class of men. In the United States, the
attempt to legitimize this class of physicians was brought about through the
complete restructuring of medical schools. The famous 1910 Flexner report,
commissioned by the Carnegie Corporation, resulted in the closing of
scores of medical schools for failing to meet the new "scientific" criteria.
The new guidelines were based upon the mechanistic and mathematical
ideas that had begun to dominate the field of science in Europe. Course
requirements were to include a thorough immersion in anatomy, chemistry,
pathology, and physics. Approved schools were also to provide full-time
research faculty as well as a solid, technological base- the modern research
laboratory. Many of the schools that were closed for failing to meet these
criteria had been havens for women and blacks. The "regulars" thus
successfully attained their current status as an elite profession, fully
"legitimized" by the mystique of science.
Today's medical schools are living monuments to the victory of
"science" over the earlier holistic worldview. Students now emerge from
medical school with myriad courses in chemistry and physics but not aFrom Healing Herbs to Deadly Drugs 6
single course in the art of healing herbs. At most, the medical school
graduate will have received one course in nutrition. He or she will enter the
medical world with the faith of a true believer in the power of "science" (and
drugs) to "cure."
The medical profession achieved ascendence over the holistic tradition
largely because it was able to convince the public that their new drugs were
the major factors in the elimination of infectious disease. The medical
profession was, in fact, born of the germ/drug theory of disease on which it
continues to thrive to this day. Although strong evidence suggests that most
of the major infectious diseases declined most rapidly before the discovery of
the much-touted vaccination programs and that there was no obvious change
after the drugs were introduced,21 the medical profession continues to
proudly proclaim this "conquest" as its own. Careful studies, however, point
to the decisive influence of environmental factors- improved nutrition and
cleaner water and air.22 Many of these improvements in health standards
were the product of the Popular Health Movement of the 1830s and 1840s
which was spearheaded by women.
Western medicine obstinately continues to deny the importance of
environmental and lifestyle factors in the causation of disease. Even though
it has been estimated that 80 percent or more of all cancers are attributable to
environmental factors,23 medical research continues to pour billions of
dollars into finding magic (chemical) cures for this and other diseases.
Approximately seventy thousand chemicals are presently in everyday use
throughout the world with five hundred to one thousand new ones added to
the list each year.24 Our food is poisoned with pesticides and drugs and
industries routinely pollute our water and our air. Research has also shown
that meat-eating is a major cause of disease, not only due to the myriad
chemicals and hormones that factory farm animals are forced to ingest, but
also due to the high levels of protein, bacteria, cholesterol and fat that are
found in meat.25 And yet, the medical profession spends only a fraction of
the health dollar on research into the prevention of disease.
One of the reasons for this skewed sense of priorities is that prevention is
simply not a very dramatic thing to do. Western medicine is founded upon
the notion of the heroic conquest of nature. To credit the environment or
lifestyle with importance is letting nature steal the show. To concede that
plants, exercise, food, and clean air may have more to do with healing than
western medicine's arsenal of drugs is to remove the very foundation upon
which western medicine is based.
Thus, industries continue to pollute our environment with toxic chemicals
and drugs while medical scientists continue to refine increasingly potent
drugs to "cure" us of the illnesses that our poisoned environment has
produced; pharmaceutical industries bombard both our inner and outer
"environment" with the equally toxic chemicals and drugs.
Western medicine's preference for the development and marketing of
dangerous drugs over the earlier use of healing herbs is a direct product of
its mechanistic beliefs. Rather than use the entire plant, western medicine
prefers to isolate the plant's most active ingredients in order to develop a
more potent force. However, in general, isolated and "refined" drugs are
much more toxic than are the substances from which they are derived. (It is
no coincidence that the word "pharmaceutical" derives from an ancient
Greek word meaning "poison.") It appears that the combined properties of
plants serve complementary functions providing safeguards that are missing
when particular ingredients are refined and extracted from the whole plant. It
would seem that the attempt to divide nature is a risky affair. To cite just one
example: The foxglove leaf was used safely for thousands of years as an aid
for those with heart problems. The drug "digitalis" was later isolated and
refined and is now a standardized drug for heart disease. The problem,
however, is that digitalis, unlike the foxglove leaf, is a deadly drug whose
dosage needs to be carefully monitored. In its attempt to isolate the most
powerful ingredient of the foxglove leaf, Western medicine replaced the
earlier healing herb with a poisonous drug.267 HEALING THE WOUNDS
Nowhere has the warfare model of modern western medicine had more
tragic consequences than in its treatment of nonhuman animals. Nonhuman
animals have become one of the major victims in western medicine's war
against the natural world. They are the basic fodder used by the medical war
machine.
Sadly, most of the current medical dollar is spent on zoological research
which studies not how to help humans get well but, rather, how to make
healthy animals sick. Day in and day out, animals are cut, burned, poisoned,
starved, shocked, gassed, and frozen- all in the name of science.
In many of the earliest cultures, animals were viewed as the guardians of
nature's secrets. Today, laboratory animals are literally pierced by the tools
of science in hopes they will yield their secrets to the modern rational mind.
Throughout patriarchal cultures, animals have been sacrificed to the gods
in the hopes of attaining fertility, abundance and renewed life. Today, we
are told that the god of Progress requires the same sacrifice of animal life.
Significantly, researchers do not "kill" animals in laboratories; the word
"sacrifice" is still employed. Behind the sacrifice of animals at the altar of
science lies the ancient and tragic belief that somehow, if animals are killed,
human beings will be allowed to live.
Although animals had been "sacrificed," dissected, and experimented
upon for thousands of years, it was only with the advent of the mechanistic
worldview that such experimentation became an integral part of medical
science. Since, according to the Cartesian worldview, animals were mere
machines and could feel no pain, the ethical issues involved in animal
experimentation were easily excised.
Thus, feeling, caring, and intuition were successfully banned from the
laboratory with the advent of the mechanistic age. The true scientific spirit
was decreed to follow the dictates of reason, not the feelings of the heart.
Western medicine thus set out to conquer not only external nature but inner
nature as well. Biomedical research on animals continues to follow this
ideal. As today's medical student cuts into a laboratory animal, he
simultaneously cuts himself off from his feelings of connection with other
forms of life. He "conquers" all feelings of love and compassion with the
power of the "rational" mind.
Whereas the church justified the abuse of animals (and women) by the
claim that they were lacking in souls, today's biomedical research scientists
attempt to justify laboratory experimentation by the contention that
nonhuman animals are lacking in "rationality." Once again, "reason" is
touted as the quality that elevates humans above the natural world. Why
"reason" should be viewed as the most important trait that a being can
possess is never "reasonably" explained.
The human capacity to "reason" is, indeed, unique, as a glance at the
thinking of animal research scientists shows. Thus, while researchers
attempt to justify animal experimentation by the claim that animals are
different from human beings, they also seek to justify it scientifically by
"reasoning" that animals are similar to human beings. But, although animals
are similar to humans in the important aspects of life- i.e., they feel joy,
sadness, loneliness, and fear- their physiologies differ significantly from our
own. Each species has a unique constitution and develops diseases and
responds to drugs in very different ways. Thus, "penicillin kills guinea pigs.
But the same guinea pigs can safely eat strychnine, one of the deadliest
poisons for humans- but not for monkeys"; opium is "harmless to dogs and
chickens"; "morphine, which calms and anesthetizes humans, causes
maniacal excitement in cats and mice"; thalidomide, though tested
extensively and "proven" safe in several species, later caused birth defects
in the ten thousand children born to pregnant mothers who took this drug.27
The stressful, artificial conditions in which laboratory animals are forced
to live make generalization to the real life situation of humans an even
greater leap of faith. Humans do not live in cages or germ-free
environments; nor are their diseases induced by artificial means. A cancer
or illness that grows organically follows a very different course from one
that has been artificially induced.From Healing Herbs to Deadly Drugs 8
The same faulty reasoning plagues not only medical research but product
testing on animals as well. A large portion of animal experimentation cannot
even claim to have lofty goals, consisting instead in the routine testing of
consumer products including chemicals and drugs. None of these tests could
be further removed from the actual conditions of the real world.
Of course, the ultimate experiment for every new drug occurs when it is
ingested by human beings. A vicious cycle exists in which dangerous drugs
are marketed because they "prove" safe in tests on animals; when such
drugs then go on to produce illnesses and disease, animals are, once again,
made the victims in science's search for elusive cures.
One of the major reasons that companies insist on using animal
experimentation is the convenient legal alibi that animal research provides.
When drug companies want to market a drug, they argue for the similarity
between human and nonhuman animals. Conversely, when adverse
reactions occur, they are quick to reply that animal studies cannot be applied
with complete accuracy to human beings. The manufacturers of thalidomide
were, in fact, acquitted on the grounds that research on animals could not
reliably predict how a drug would affect human beings.28
When legal restraints are lifted, drug manufacturers show where their
true priorities lie. Many chemicals and drugs that have been banned in the
United States are actively promoted in Third World countries, where drug
manufacturers can more easily ignore their disastrous results.29
Another reason for the continued existence of animal research and the
drug industry is the profit motive. One of the perceived drawbacks of herbs
is that they cannot be patented. Manufactured drugs, by contrast, produce
billions of dollars every year. Likewise, animal experimentation is a multi-
billion-dollar business providing enormous profits for the researchers,
universities, breeders of animals, manufacturers of animal equipment, and
pharmaceutical companies.
Since western medicine has left behind the tradition of healing herbs in
preference for the development of toxic drugs, precise measurements and
testing have taken on an importance that does not exist with herbs. Since,
for the most part, herbs have a more gentle effect, there is no need for
stringent testing. Herbs have, in fact, been tested for thousands of years,
with the knowledge gained from such "tests" handed down through a rich
folk tradition. Homeopathy, a close ally of herbal healing, provides an
example of how different the concept of testing is within the holistic
tradition. According to homeopathy, the best tests for the effect of a remedy
are the ones that physicians perform on themselves.
Western medicine shows a preference for only those drugs that produce
dramatic and visible effects. Due to its mechanistic and heroic orientation, it
seeks a quick technological "fix" to restore the appearance of health. Even
such emotional problems as grief, anxiety, and depression are now thought
to have quick chemical "cures." This contrasts sharply with the basic
principles of holistic healing in which the attempt is to improve health in a
more profound and lasting way. Thus, in herbal healing, the best herbs are
considered not those that produce an immediate, dramatic effect, but rather
those that improve health gradually over a period of time.
Modern western medicine has sought to salvage disease from the
untamed conditions of the natural world. Within the "controlled" setting of
their laboratories, researchers have sought to replicate disease and to
manufacture cures. But while medical scientists have been looking for
"miracle" cures in their laboratories (apart from the natural world), the
healing power of nature has continued to manifest itself throughout our
lives. When we cut ourselves and our blood clots and our wound later heals
with no outside help, we have seen its power at work. This regenerative life-
force pervades every cell of our bodies. All of the various holistic or
"alternative" practices attempt to affirm and work with this healing force.
Different cultures have called it by a number of names. There is the Prana9 HEALING THE WOUNDS
of India, the Chi of China and the Ki of Japan. The very word physis, from
which our word "physician" derives, refers to both "Nature" and to this
"vital force."
Although many of us have lost our connection to this healing power, it
is one that nonhuman animals still retain. Animals do, ironically, have
something to teach us, but it is not a knowledge that can be wrenched from
their bodies behind laboratory walls. Many nonhuman animals know
instinctively what to do when ill. For example, a "wild turkey during the
rainy season force-feeds her young with leaves of the spice bush; a dog
with a digestive problem chews upon the witch grass to produce vomiting;
a bear feeds upon the fruit of rockberry with relish while fern roots
become his healing agent; the wolf, bitten by a venomous snake, seeks out
and chews snakeroot."30 "Cats and dogs purge themselves with certain
grasses and lie in wet mud (a source of natural 'antibiotic') in case of snake
or insect bites or other irritations."31 Wild animals will also naturally seek
solitude and relaxation when ill.
Another example of "animal medicine" was discovered by a researcher
in Africa. On certain days, he observed a group of chimpanzees traveling
long distances in search of a shrub called Aspilia pluriseta. After carefully
selecting particular leaves, the chimpanzees roll the leaves around one by
one in their mouths, eventually swallowing them with a grimace. Aspilia
pluriseta has since been found to contain a highly reactive red oil (thiarubin
A) that is known to kill Candida albicans or Staphylococcus albus. In a nearby
tribe it was found that the same species of leaf was consumed by humans
to treat surface wounds, such as cuts and burns, and for stomach aches.
People used the same three species used by the chimpanzees, but a species
not used by chimpanzees was also not used by humans.32
Did these people learn their medicine through their observation of
animals in the wild? Very possibly this is the case. A number of
commentators believe, in fact, that many of the earliest herbal remedies
used by humans were based on such observations of animals in the wild.
The American Indians, who watched bears closely in order to learn what
they would eat both for food and for medicine, are a case in point.
But how do animals distinguish plants and roots that are helpful from
those that cause harm? Perhaps the best answer we can offer is that they
are guided by instinct or natural knowing. Humans also have such instincts
although we prefer to call them intuitions when referring to ourselves. In
all probability, these instincts or intuitions guided humans as well as
animals in their earliest forms of healing.33
Edward Bach, after whom "Bach Flower Essences" are named, provides
a modern-day example of this phenomenon. Bach believed in using
intuition as a guide to discovering the right plant medicine. These instincts
or intuitions are our connection to the natural world and to the life energy
that helps us to maintain health. In contrast to western, patriarchal
medicine which aspires to be a science, such intuitive modes of healing
resemble far more an art.
Unfortunately, most of this art has been lost to the modern world. Most
of us have lost not only the actual knowledge of ancient healing practices
but also the instincts and intuitions that formerly guided us toward health.
We typically eat foods that are devoid of nutritional value and that contain
numerous chemicals and additives that are harmful to our health.
Similarly, we often fail to heed the subtle warnings that tell us to beware of
dangerous pharmaceutical drugs.
Although western medicine's war against the body and against nature
shows little sign of abating, significant signs of hope are also to be found.
One source of hope can be seen in the growth of the animal liberation
movement over the last ten years. Animal researchers compare the
members of this growing movement to the Luddites who vainly smashed
their machines in an attempt to forestall the modern, technological age.
However, it is the very conception of animals as machines that the animal
liberation movement seeks to destroy. The animal liberation movement,From Healing Herbs to Deadly Drugs 10
therefore, does pose one of the greatest challenges to the modern,
technological age and to the mechanistic conception of life.
Other signs of promise can be found in the growth of the holistic health
healing movement. This movement is encouraging not only because of the
number of "alternative" health care practitioners who are emerging and the
number of people who are now turning to such practitioners for their
health care needs, but also because of the knowledge of holistic health care
that has reached the public at large. More and more people are
incorporating meditation, herbal supplements, yoga and other holistic
practices into their daily lives; for the true role of a health care practitioner
is not that of a mechanistic "curer" of disease, but rather that of a teacher
who can guide us in working with the powers of the natural world.34
The wisdom of living in harmony with nature was possessed by our
ancestors and is a heritage we would do well to reclaim. This wisdom
embodies the principle of nonviolence so alien to modern western
medicine in its war against the natural world. Holistic healing is a vital
way in which we can honor this wisdom. By helping to integrate body,
mind, instinct, and intuition, holistic healing enables us to live in harmony
and ecological balance with all of the natural world. Along with the
ecofeminist, environmental, and animal liberation movements, of which it
is an integral part, holistic healing provides a formidable challenge to the
violence perpetrated upon nature by the patriarchal mind. It is an antiwar
protest of its own, helping to bring forth a world of peace and nonviolence
for all living beings.
